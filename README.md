## Gameplay

The game starts with a menu that allows you to choose the mode of play. You can play against the AI or watch the AI play against itself. When playing against the AI, you also have the option to choose your side (white or black).

To make a move, simply click the piece you want to move, and then click the square you want to move it to. If the move is legal, the piece will move. If the move is not legal, a message will display in the center of the screen for one second.
